We are fighting a war against an invisible threat. Many countries are now implementing unprecedented measures to contain the COVID-19 virus, Most closed their borders and imposed a mandatory quarantine. Although necessary, these measures might not be sustainable. Many people are now prevented from work which has a huge impact on our daily life.

With COVID-19 TRACING we want to support all the tracing effort and provide a platform where you can share and get information about places with a potential higher infection risk in the last couple of days. [Contact tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing) is the process of identifying people who may have come into contact with an infected person.

By making this information available, we hope that together with the efforts being made to increase the number of tests and developing a treatment (see also [trace, test, treat](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/who-urges-countries-to-track-and-trace-every-covid-19-case) recommendations by the WHO), people will be able to gradually return to their daily routines.
