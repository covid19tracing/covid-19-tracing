# About COVID-19 Tracing

## Our Vision:
In times of the COVID-19 epidemic, people can live their normal lives again as a proper [trace, test, treat](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/who-urges-countries-to-track-and-trace-every-covid-19-case) method is in place.

## Our Mission:
Providing a platform to speed up tracing and inform the society about Covid-19 infectious hot spots on a map which show a high infection rate in the past days.

## The project
We are a couple of tech people who want to help in times of this corona crisis. We know that contact tracing is difficult and needs a lot of manual effort.
Instead of tracking all mobile phones and all related privacy issues, our platform allows COVID-19 positive tested people to anonymously upload their google location data (only the last few days) for contact tracing. We aggregate all data and show infectious hot spots on a map that were visited by a lot of people who were tested positive later. A good example would be the Austrian ski resort that spread the coronavirus around Europe ([Spiegel International, 2020-03-17](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/ischgl-austrian-ski-resort-flings-coronavirus-around-europe-a-68e10295-1d9c-42cc-9e52-7fea35436479)).


## Privacy
We are computer scientists and know about the importance of privacy. That is why we implemented the system using the highest security standards and we also try to anonymize the location data as much as possible. The data of multiple people are aggregated, blured by reducing precision, and filtered. Thus, the possibility to track back to individuals is minimized.  

## How can you help us?
