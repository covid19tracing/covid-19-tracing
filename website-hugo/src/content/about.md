# About COVID-19 Tracing

We are a couple of tech people who want to help in times of this corona crisis. We know that contact tracing is quite difficult and needs a lot of manual effort.

Instead of tracking all mobile phones, our platform allows patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus to anonymously upload their google location data (only the last few days) for a contact tracing.

We need to be able to contain this threat without stoping our economy completly.

Many countries are now implementing unprecedented measures to contain the COVID-19 virus, most closed their borders and imposed a mandatory quarantine. Although necessary, this measure can not last much longer. Many people are now prevented from work which might lead to many businesses going bankrupt.

How can we fight an invisible threat?

Instead of individually, countries must work together in order to trace the virus and make it visible.
We developed a simple system that each country can implement in order to anonymously trace the location history of patients that were diagnosed with the novel corona virus. This way we can quarantine areas with high probability of infection allowing people outside of these zones to leave their homes for work, limited social interaction and providing for their families.

**What are the next steps?**

- As a patient diagnosed as COVID-19 positive:

    - Reach out to us. We will provide you with a token that you will be able to use to report your case.

- As part of an official health organisation

    - Reach out to us. We will provide you access to our confirmation tokens so that you can distribute to COVID positive patientes.

- Everyone else:

    - Share our message and help us reach the official health organisations
