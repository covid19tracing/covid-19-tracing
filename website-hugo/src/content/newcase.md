# Upload your location history

**We will never publish your raw data!**

{{< uploadform >}}

## When can you upload a new trace?

- You have been tested COVID-19 positive by an official institution.
- You have a Google account, an Android mobile phone and you had tracking activated on your mobile phone (usually it is activated by default on Android phones). Not sure? Just login to [Google's timeline](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline) and check if you can see your location history.
- You have got a code to upload your trace. ([Contact us if you need a code.](/about/#contact))
- You have downloaded your Google Location History ([see our step-by-step guide how to do download it](/howto))
